### Scientific Computing with Python Projects

It's time to put your Python skills to the test. By completing these projects, you'll demonstrate that you have a strong foundational knowledge of Python. And you'll qualify for freeCodeCamp's Scientific Computing with Python Certification.


1. **Arithmetic Formatter**

Create a function that receives a list of strings that are arithmetic problems and returns the problems arranged vertically and side-by-side. The function should optionally take a second argument. When the second argument is set to True, the answers should be displayed.

2. **Time Calculator**

Write a function named add_time that takes in two required parameters and one optional parameter:

- A start time in the 12-hour clock format (ending in AM or PM)
- A duration time that indicates the number of hours and minutes
- A starting day of the week, case insensitive (optional) 

The function should add the duration time to the start time and return the result.
